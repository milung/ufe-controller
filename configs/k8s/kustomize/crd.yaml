                    URI from which the module shall be access. The actual module is cached by the

                    The modules are not preloaded by default but only when naviagting to some of the 
                    subpaths mentioned at the `navigation` list. Setting this property to true
                    emsures that the module is loaded when application starts.

                    Specifies if the web components loading shall be proxied by the controller. 
                    This is usefull if the web component is served from the cluster and 
                    not accessible from the outside of the cluster network. The module will be served
                    from the URL `<base controller URI>/web-components/<WebComponent name>.jsm`. 
                    This is recommended approach for the standard assumed use-case.

                  description: |
                    A hash string to identify the particular version of the module uri in case of 
                    controller proxying it. If `proxy` property is set, and `hash` property is set then 
                    the final module file name is `<WebComponent name>.<hash-suffix>.jsm` and the resource is 
                    assumed to never expire. To refresh user agents` caches, one needs to change the hash 
                    to a new unique value.
